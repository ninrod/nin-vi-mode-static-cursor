NIN-VI-MODE
=======

This plugin increases ZLE, the zsh line editor, `vi-like` capabilities.

* Press `ESC` to enter `normal` mode.

Mode indicators
---------------

* I provide none. The only indicator you'll have will be the cursor shape dynamic behaviour.


Vim edition: for when things get hairy
-------------------------------------

* I've bound `gs` to fire up `vim` so you can edit your command with full powers.
